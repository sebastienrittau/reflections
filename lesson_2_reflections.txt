What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you use git init git creates all of the meta data needed to track the history 
of the files you choose to add to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different than the working directory because the staging area contains the files that you want
to commit in the next commit while the working directory contains every file. This allows you to make a commit
but not commit everything at once.
